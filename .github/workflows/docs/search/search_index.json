Dataset is released : visit CodaLab competition website Motivation Due to the widespread use of the Internet and social media platforms, most languages are becoming digitally available. This allows for various artificial intelligence (AI) applications that enable tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation and hateful content detection. According to UNESCO (2003), 30% of all living languages, around 2,058, are African languages. However, most of these languages do not have curated datasets for developing such AI applications. Recently, various individual and funded initiatives, such as the Lacuna Fund, have set out to reverse this trend and create such datasets for African languages. However, research is required to determine both the suitability of current natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the development of novel techniques to maximize the applications of such datasets. There has been a growing interest in sentiment analysis which applies to many domains, including public health, commerce/business, art and literature, social sciences, neuroscience, and psychology ( Mohammad, Saif M, 2022 ). Previous shared tasks on sentiment analysis include Mohammad, Saif M et al., (2018), Nakov et al., (2016), Pontiki et al., Ghosh et al., (2015), (2014), and so on . However, none of these tasks included African languages. Though Mohammad, Saif, et al. (2018) included standard Arabic, we focus on Arabic dialects from African countries: Algerian Arabic and Tunisian Arabizi . We believe SemEval is the right venue, due to its popularity and widespread acceptance, to carry out shared tasks for African languages to strengthen their further development. In this shared task, we have covered 13 African languages, 4 languages from Nigeria (Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, Nigerian Pigdin), 3 from Ethiopia (Amharic and Tigrinya), Swahili from Kenya and Tanzania, Algerian Arabic dialect from Algeria, Kinyarwanda from Ruwanda, Twi from Ghana, Mozambican Portuguese from Mozambique, 3 languages from South Africa (isiZulu, Setswana and Tsonga(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsonga_language) and Moroccan Arabic/Darija (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_Arabic). In this shared task, we have covered 16 African languages, 4 languages from Nigeria ( Hausa , Yoruba , Igbo , Nigerian Pigdin ), 3 from Ethiopia ( Amharic and Tigrinya ), Swahili from Kenya and Tanzania, Algerian Arabic dialect from Algeria, Kinyarwanda from Ruwanda, Twi from Ghana, Mozambican Portuguese from Mozambique and 3 languages from South Africa ( isiZulu , Setswana , Tsonga(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsonga_language) and Moroccan Arabic/Darija (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_Arabic) Task Overview The AfriSenti-SemEval Shared Task 12 is based on a collection of Twitter datasets in 14 African languages for sentiment classification. It consists of three sub-tasks. Participants can select one or more tasks depending on their preference. Task A: Monolingual Sentiment Classification Given training data in a target language, determine the polarity of a tweet in the target language (positive, negative, or neutral). If a tweet For messages conveying both a positive and negative sentiment, whichever is the stronger sentiment should be chosen. This sub-task has 12 tracks: Note: You are free to select one or more tracks in this sub-task. Track 1: Hausa Track 2: Yoruba Track 3: Igbo Track 4: Nigerian_Pidgin Track 5: Amharic Track 6: Algerian Arabic Track 7: Moroccan Arabic/Darija, Track 8: Swahili Track 9: Kinyarwanda Track 10: Twi Track 11: Mozambican Portuguese Track 12: Xitsonga (Mozambique Dialect) Track 13: Setswana (data to be released soon) Track 14: isiZulu (data to be released soon) Track 15: Xitsonga (South-African Dialect, to be released soon) Note: Tweets in each language are code-mix. Read our NaijaSenti paper for more information. Task B: Multilingual Sentiment Classification Given combined training data from Task-A (Track 1 to 12), determine the polarity of a tweet in the target language (positive, negative, or neutral). This sub-task has only one track with 12 languages (Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, Nigerian_Pidgin, Amharic, Algerian Arabic, Moroccan Arabic/Darija, Swahili, Kinyarwanda, Twi, Mozambican Portuguese, and Xitsonga(Mozambique Dialect)): Track 15: 12 languages in Task A Given a combined training data from 10 African languages, determine the polarity of a tweet in the target language (positive, negative, or neutral). This sub-task has only one track: Task C: Zero-Shot Sentiment Classification Given unlabelled tweets in two African languages (Tigrinya and Oromo), leverage any or all of the available training datasets (in Task:A ) to determine the sentiment of a tweet in the two target languages. This task has three (2) tracks. Note: You are free to select one or more tracks in this sub-task. Track 16: Zero-Shot on Tigrinya Track 17: Zero-Shot on Oromo Dataset Examples The dataset involves tweets labeled with three sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral) in 14 African languages. Each tweet is annotated by three annotators following the annotation guidelines in ( Mohammad, Saif M, 2016 ). We use a form of majority vote to determine the sentiment of the tweet. See more in our paper ( Muhammad et al., 2022 , Yimam et al., 2020 ).

This sub-task has only one track (13 languages): Track 14: All languages in Task A Task C: Zero-Shot Sentiment Classification Given unlabeled tweets in three African languages (Tigrinya, Xitsonga and Oromo), leverage any or all of the available training datasets in Subtasks 1 and 2 to determine the sentiment of a tweet in the three target languages is positive, negative, or neutral. This task has three (3) tracks. This task starts on the 1st of October, 2022. Track 15: Zero-Shot on Tigrinya ( dev and test sets to be released ) Track 16: Zero-Shot on Xitsonga ( dev and test sets to be released ) Track 17: Zero-Shot on Oromo ( dev and test sets to be released ) Dataset Examples The dataset involves tweets labeled with three sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral) in 14 African languages. Each tweet is annotated by three annotators following the annotation guidelines in ( Mohammad, Saif M, 2016 ). We use a form of majority vote to determine the sentiment of the tweet. See more in our paper ( Muhammad et al., 2022 , Yimam et al., 2020 ). Below is a sample dataset for the 4 Nigerian languges (Muhammad et al., 2022): The datasets are available on the competition website. Why Participate ?

Participants can work on any or all of the subtasks. The participants can form a team with multiple people, or a single person team is okay. The participants can experiment with the training data to develop models. Usage of any external data or resources is allowed and highly encouraged. This process can run util the evaluation period. Evaluation period: Organisers will release the test set containing instances without the labels. The participants will use their developed models to predict the labels for the instances, and they have to create a submission file that follows exactly the same format as the training data. These prediction files should be submitted to Codalab submission portal (will be announced later). These predictions will be compared against the ground truth labels of the test data and the teams will be ranked on a leaderboard according to the performance score. Each team is encouraged to write a system description paper describing their submission system, including interesting insights, and submit it before the due date. After a review period, each team has to update their submitted paper based on the review feedback and submit the camera-ready version. Accepted papers will be published as part of the proceedings of the SemEval 2023 Workshop (link). Trial Data We provide a sample dataset for the shared task. Check the Github repository . Training Data coming soon Submission Website We will be accepting and evaluating your submissions on CodaLab . The submission page will be available soon!
