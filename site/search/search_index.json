Participants can select one or more sub-tasks depending on their preference.</p> <p>Task A: Supervised</p> <p> In this subtask, participants submit systems that have been trained using the provided labeled datasets (with scores ranging from 0 to 1 representing the degree of semantic textual relatedness). These datasets contain pairs of sentences that have been manually scored based on their degree of relatedness. Participating teams are allowed to use other relatedness and similarity datasets or datasets in other languages. However, they must report additional data they used, and ideally report how impactful each resource was on the final results.</p> <p>Task B: Unsupervised</p> <p> In this subtask, participants are to submit systems that have been developed without the use of any labeled datasets pertaining to semantic relatedness or semantic similarity between units of text more than two words long in any language.
