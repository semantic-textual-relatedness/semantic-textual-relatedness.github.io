Two sentences are considered semantically similar when they have a paraphrasal or entailment relation (e.g., The boy scored the winning goal. , The boy scored the winning goal. ). On the other hand, relatedness is a much broader concept that accounts for all the commonalities between two sentences. For example The boy scored the winning goal. and The boy's team moved onto the finals. would be related though not similar. However, much of past NLP work is on semantic similarity, and largely focused on English. In this shared task, we have covered 17 African languages, Hausa , Yoruba , Igbo , Nigerian Pidgin from Nigeria, Amharic , Tigrinya , and Oromo from Ethiopia, Swahili from Kenya and Tanzania, Algerian Arabic dialect from Algeria, Kinyarwanda from Rwanda, Twi from Ghana, Mozambique Portuguese from Mozambique and Moroccan Arabic/Darija from Morocco. Task Overview The Semantic Textual Relatedness Shared Task 1 is the task of predicting semantic textual relatedness (STR) of sentence pairs. Participants will rank sentence pairs by their closeness in meaning (i.e., their degree of semantic relatedness) \\cite{mohammad2008measuring} in 14 languages predominantly from Africa and Asia. All sentence pairs will have manually determined relatedness scores between 0 (completely unrelated) and 1 (maximally related). It consists of two sub-tasks. Participants can select one or more sub-tasks depending on their preference. Task A: Monolingual Sentiment Classification Given training data in a target language, determine the polarity of a tweet in the target language (positive, negative, or neutral). If a tweet conveys both a positive and negative sentiment, whichever is the stronger sentiment should be chosen. This sub-task has 15 tracks: Task B: Monolingual Sentiment Classification Given training data in a target language, determine the polarity of a tweet in the target language (positive, negative, or neutral).

Update (4 October): We released an updated dataset (Version 2.0). Disregard the previous version and download the current. We added Mozambican Portuguese and will soon release other languages after the annotation Motivation Due to the widespread use of the Internet and social media platforms, most languages are becoming digitally available. This allows for various artificial intelligence (AI) applications that enable tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation and hateful content detection. According to UNESCO (2003), 30% of all living languages, around 2,058, are African languages. However, most of these languages do not have curated datasets for developing such AI applications. Recently, various individual and funded initiatives, such as the Lacuna Fund, have set out to reverse this trend and create such datasets for African languages. However, research is required to determine both the suitability of current natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the development of novel techniques to maximize the applications of such datasets. There has been a growing interest in sentiment analysis which applies to many domains, including public health, commerce/business, art and literature, social sciences, neuroscience, and psychology ( Mohammad, Saif M, 2022 ). Previous shared tasks on sentiment analysis include Mohammad, Saif M et al., (2018), Nakov et al., (2016), Pontiki et al., Ghosh et al., (2015), (2014), and so on . However, none of these tasks included African languages. Though Mohammad, Saif, et al. (2018) included standard Arabic, we focus on Arabic dialects from African countries: Algerian Arabic and Tunisian Arabizi . We believe SemEval is the right venue, due to its popularity and widespread acceptance, to carry out shared tasks for African languages to strengthen their further development. In this shared task, we have covered 17 African languages, Hausa , Yoruba , Igbo , Nigerian Pidgin from Nigeria, Amharic , Tigrinya , and Oromo from Ethiopia, Swahili from Kenya and Tanzania, Algerian Arabic dialect from Algeria, Kinyarwanda from Rwanda, Twi from Ghana, Mozambique Portuguese from Mozambique and Moroccan Arabic/Darija from Morocco. Task Overview The AfriSenti-SemEval Shared Task 12 is based on a collection of Twitter datasets in 14 African languages for sentiment classification. It consists of three sub-tasks. Participants can select one or more sub-tasks depending on their preference. In each sub-task also, the participant may wish to participate in any number of languages as so wished. Task A: Monolingual Sentiment Classification Given training data in a target language, determine the polarity of a tweet in the target language (positive, negative, or neutral). If a tweet conveys both a positive and negative sentiment, whichever is the stronger sentiment should be chosen. This sub-task has 15 tracks: Note: You are free to select one or more tracks in this sub-task. Track 1: Hausa Track 2: Yoruba Track 3: Igbo Track 4: Nigerian_Pidgin Track 5: Amharic Track 6: Algerian Arabic Track 7: Moroccan Arabic/Darija, Track 8: Swahili Track 9: Kinyarwanda Track 10: Twi Track 11: Mozambican Portuguese Track 12: Xitsonga ( Mozambique Dialect ) Track 13: Setswana (data to be released soon) Track 14: isiZulu (data to be released soon) Track 15: Xitsonga (South-African Dialect, to be released soon) Note: Tweets in each language are code-mix. Read our NaijaSenti paper for more information. Task B: Multilingual Sentiment Classification Given combined training data from Task-A (Track 1 to 12), determine the polarity of a tweet in the target language (positive, negative, or neutral). This sub-task has only one track with 12 languages (Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, Nigerian_Pidgin, Amharic, Algerian Arabic, Moroccan Arabic/Darija, Swahili, Kinyarwanda, Twi, Mozambican Portuguese, and Xitsonga( Mozambique Dialect )): Track 16: 12 languages in Task A Task C: Zero-Shot Sentiment Classification Given unlabelled tweets in two African languages (Tigrinya and Oromo), leverage any or all of the available training datasets (in Task:A ) to determine the sentiment of a tweet in the two target languages. This task has two (2) tracks. Note: You are free to select one or more tracks in this sub-task. Track 17: Zero-Shot on Tigrinya Track 18: Zero-Shot on Oromo Dataset Examples The dataset involves tweets labelled with three sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral) in 14 African languages. Each tweet is annotated by three annotators following the annotation guidelines in ( Mohammad, Saif M, 2016 ). We use a form of a majority vote to determine the sentiment of the tweet. See more in our paper ( Muhammad et al., 2022 , Yimam et al., 2020 ). Below is a sample dataset for the 4 Nigerian languages (Muhammad et al., 2022): The datasets are available on the Participate tab . Starter Kit?
